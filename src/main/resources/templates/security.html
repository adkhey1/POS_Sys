            <h6>Security</h6>

            <p>
                We want to ensure that Instagram continues to be safe and enjoyable for every user.
                Please take a moment to read these tips on the features we've developed and best practices
                to keep you safe on Instagram:
            </p>

            <ul class="container">
                <li>
                    If someone shares photos or videos that make you uncomfortable, you can either unfollow
                    them or block them. You can also report something you think is against our community guidelines
                    directly through the app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check whether your account is public or private. If you set your posts to private, anyone who
                    wants to see your posts, followers or follower list will have to send you a follower request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are a victim of bullying, contact a family member close to you or a teacher and ask for help.
                    You can also remove a comment from a photo you have shared and report bullying and harassment
                    through
                    the help section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should feel comfortable presenting yourself to a wider audience, such as your parents, teachers
                    or employer, through the photos you share.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Share Pictures</h6>

            <p>
                Sharing nude photos or videos or those with sexual content is against Instagram's community guidelines,
                so you can simply reply: "No, that's not allowed on Instagram."

                But even outside of Instagram, you should think carefully about what the consequences would be
                if pictures or videos that show you naked or performing sexual acts end up in someone else's hands.
                Because that can happen as soon as someone shares a photo or video. Sometimes people make mistakes,
                stupid jokes or are angry and share things they should rather keep to themselves.

                If you are under 18, it is especially important for you to know that sharing nude or sexually explicit
                photos of minors - on the internet, on mobile phones, by email or by other means - is illegal in most
                countries and can have serious legal consequences for the photographer and for those who request the
                images.
