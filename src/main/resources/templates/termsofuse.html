            <h6>Terms of use</h6>

            <p>
                These terms of use (the "Terms of Use") govern your use of Instagram, unless we expressly
                state that
                separate terms of use (and not these Terms of Use) apply. They also provide information
                about the Instagram
                service (the "Service"), as explained below. When you create an Instagram account or use
                Instagram,
                you agree to these Terms of Use. The Meta Terms of Use do not apply to this Service.

                obliged to
                provide under the European Electronic Communications Code.

                If you are a business established in the European Union and you use Instagram Shopping to
                sell goods to
                consumers in the EU, you can find out more about your business relationship with us in the
                Platform-to-Business
                Notice. This notice supplements our terms of use.

                The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland
                Limited.
                Therefore, these Terms of Use constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland
                Limited.

            <h6>The service</h6>

            <p>
                We are committed to providing you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all
                Instagram products,
                features, apps, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's
                mission:
                To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The service consists of the following
                aspects:
            </p>

            <ul class="container">
                <li>Provide personalised opportunities to create content, connect, communicate, discover and share.
                    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that
                    really matter to you. That's why we develop systems to identify who and what matters to you and
                    others.
                    We then use this information to help you create, find and share content and engage in experiences
                    that matter to you. This includes highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that may be
                    of interest to you based on your and others' activities on and off Instagram, and offering you ways
                    to use Instagram.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Promoting a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer
                    resources to members of our community to help make their experiences positive and inclusive,
                    including when we think they might need support. We also have teams and systems in place to combat
                    abuse and violations of our terms of use and policies, as well as harmful and fraudulent behaviour.
                    We use the information we have - including your information - to keep our platform safe. In
                    addition,
                    we may share information about abuse or harmful content with other meta-companies or with law
                    enforcement agencies. Learn more about this in the Data Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developing and using technology to help us serve our growing community consistently.
                    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is a central aspect of our service.
                    A large part of our service is building and using cutting-edge technologies that help us
                    personalise,
                    protect and improve our service at an extraordinary scale for a very large global community.
                    Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning enable us to apply complex
                    processes to our service. Automated techniques also help us ensure the functionality and integrity
                    of our service.
